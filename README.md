# DE2-115_LCD_FSM

This project is designed for the Altera DE2-115 board (Cyclone IV E family).

Its purpose is to upload the first 5 letters of my name onto the board's LCD (one letter a clock cycle.) Additionally, we use a slider switch to reverse the direction of how my name is printed onto the LCD.

KEY(3) is used as a reset.
SW(1) is used to alternate directionality.
